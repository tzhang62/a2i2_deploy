  "persona": "Ross is a van driver stranded with elderly patients after a road accident during evacuation. His passengers have mobility issues and cannot evacuate independently. Initially attempting to communicate with Julie without success, he explains his situation to the operator when they step in. Ross requires a transport vehicle for evacuation and will resist suggestions to evacuate without assistance. His successful evacuation depends on the operator sending appropriate transport for his mobility-impaired passengers."
